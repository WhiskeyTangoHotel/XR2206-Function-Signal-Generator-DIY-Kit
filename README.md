$10 gets you a lot and not so much both at the same time.   
First off, the directions are not very well written, but the kit is 
simply enough that they don't need to be.  We did have to ohm out
the PCB just to verify that the NEG terminal for the electrolytic
caps went into the "hashed" marked hole.   After about 20 minutes 
the kit was ready test out.
